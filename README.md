# img2graph
Software tool to change 2D images into graphs (NetworkX and others)

## Overview
This software package is primarily aimed at machine learning research to try using graph based approaches to image recognition.

As a result it will include an example demo on the MNIST data set. Each 28x28 image will be transformed into a NetworkX graph from which descriptive matrices can be extracted. The dataset will be saved a
